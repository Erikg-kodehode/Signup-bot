# Docker Swarm Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes implemented to migrate the Morning Sign-In Bot to Docker Swarm with improved secrets management. The migration focused on securely handling sensitive information (particularly the bot token) while maintaining the existing functionality.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Secret Management

- Added support for Docker Swarm secrets in `Worker.cs`:
  - Created `TryReadDockerSecretAsync()` method to read the bot token from `/run/secrets/discord_bot_token`
  - Modified startup logic to prioritize secrets over environment variables
  - Maintained console input as fallback for development environments

```csharp
// Helper method to read bot token from Docker secret file
private async Task<string?> TryReadDockerSecretAsync()
{
    const string secretPath = "/run/secrets/discord_bot_token";
    if (File.Exists(secretPath))
    {
        try
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("Reading bot token from Docker secret");
            string token = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(secretPath);
            return token.Trim();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to read bot token from Docker secret");
        }
    }
    else
    {
        _logger.LogDebug("Docker secret file does not exist: {SecretPath}", secretPath);
    }
    return null;
}
```

### 2. Docker Compose Configuration

- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to support Docker Swarm mode:
  - Added secrets configuration
  - Configured deploy section with resource limits, restart policies, and update strategies
  - Set up proper volume management for Swarm
  - Maintained environment variables for non-sensitive configuration
  - Added development support (stdin_open, tty)

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  signin-bot:
    image: morning-signin-bot:latest
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 1
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
        delay: 5s
        max_attempts: 3
        window: 120s
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 256M
        reservations:
          memory: 128M
      update_config:
        parallelism: 1
        delay: 10s
        order: start-first
    secrets:
      - discord_bot_token
    # Other configuration...

secrets:
  discord_bot_token:
    external: true
```

### 3. Documentation

- Created comprehensive deployment documentation (`DEPLOYMENT.md`):
  - Setup instructions for both development and production environments
  - Management procedures for service, secrets, and volumes
  - Troubleshooting guides
  - Backup and restore procedures
  - Security considerations

## Requirements Verification

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Move sensitive data to Docker Swarm secrets | ✅ | Bot token now stored as a Docker secret |
| Support reading secrets in application | ✅ | Added `TryReadDockerSecretAsync()` in Worker.cs |
| Configure proper volume persistence | ✅ | Volumes configured for data and logs in docker-compose.yml |
| Support both development and production | ✅ | Console input fallback for dev, comprehensive documentation for both environments |
| Update Docker Compose for Swarm | ✅ | Added deploy section, secrets, and proper volume configuration |
| Maintain existing non-sensitive env vars | ✅ | Environment variables maintained for non-sensitive configuration |
| Document deployment process | ✅ | Created detailed DEPLOYMENT.md |

## Security Improvements

- Bot token no longer stored in environment variables
- Token accessible only to the container via mounted file
- Non-sensitive configuration still accessible via environment variables
- Limited resource usage to prevent denial-of-service
- Proper restart policies for high availability

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the application using the instructions in DEPLOYMENT.md
2. Monitor the application for any issues
3. Ensure backups are being properly managed
4. Consider implementing additional monitoring for the service

The migration to Docker Swarm has successfully addressed the security concerns while maintaining the existing functionality of the Morning Sign-In Bot.
